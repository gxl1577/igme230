        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>My intended audience are my future co-op employers and full-time employers, they would want to know who I am, what specific position I am looking for, resume, how good my site is, and finally projects and case studies that showcase my skill sets for hiring. A simple and easy user flow is important for those who have to read thousands of portfolios everyday to find potential hire.</p>
        <p>From project 2, I need to fix project links and possibly add more projects into the site. I will have to create a print CSS. Documentation page should show up in the site. Better written content quality and organization. Make sure everything work in mobile, include responsive media query and a drop down navigation. Finally I should add something for above and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>Interactivity such as css animation, mouse over animation, scroll delay may enhance the liveness of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some specific technical functionalities that my users would expect and I would definitely implement are: a logo that linked back to home page, a work tab, an about tab, a resume tab, a go back to top button, and either infinity scrolling that jumps from one project to next or a series of projects to choose from at the bottom of a project subsite.

        </p>
        <p>Contents:
            <br>
            -logo that links to homepage
            <br>
            -about tab for a about page of myself and who I am
            <br>
            <br>-resume tab for instant pdf of my resume
            <br>-top section on homepage describe who I am and what I am specialized in
            <br>-top feature section for my best project/ case studies, establishing a hierarchy
            <br>-smaller feature sections for other cool projects I’ve done in the past
            <br>-a junk section for my other “nice” works in the past
            <br>-link to email/ phone number for contacting me
            <br>-social media icons and links to them
            <br>-go back to top button for conveniency
            <br>-infinity scrolling/ feature projects within project subsite (at the bottom after user finished a project article.)
            <br>-minimalistic design with cool display fonts and readable paragraph font
        </p>
        <p>What has changed:
            <br>-Use white background this time instead of black so I can have hover shadow and some other effects that can’t be seen on black background.
            <br>-logo hover and glow animation
            <br>-nav font is to be thinner
            <br>-shadow and hover effect on projects tiles
        </p>
        <p>Design Explanation:
            I picked some good looking royalty free images from unsplash that has connection to my projects.
            I keep my color simple as black and white although some surprise color will show up on hover animation. Especially the logo. It’s a way of branding that show off colorful personality hidden behind the shadow.
            For typeface I pick Montserrat because it’s a blend between friendliness and professionalism. Which is great for my intended audience.

            Use white background this time instead of black so I can have hover shadow and some other effects that can’t be seen on black background.

            <br>-typeface from Google Fonts, copyright free
        </p>
        <p>Challenges and how I dealt with them:
            <br>-rethought about the width of the body, had to shrink it from 1440p to 1200p for readability
            <br><br>-applying more than one n-th child at a time
            <br>-responsive photo sizing: learning object fit property css
            <br>-bugs like needle in a haystack
            <br>-actually implementing flexbox and grid that I never did before
            <br>-changing block style to grid is something I’ll never do again. Too time consuming
            <br>-I noticed flaws in CSS grid such as unable to animate-in due to grid lock on content
            <br>-Another flaw: although html is simpler, extra tweak in CSS will take up a lot more code
            <br>-such applying style to specific container children becomes impossible because grid reduced container
            <br>-hard to diagnose overflow because I will have to edit grid template area as well as deleting html elements
            <br>-ran out of time
            <br>-I need to be taught how to write readable long code
            <br><br>Turning a block based site to a site that implement css grid and flexbox is really time consuming. If I were to code with grid and flexbox from start, it may be faster compared when I first coded this site without using these methods.
        </p>
        <p>Above and beyond:
<br>-creative go back to top button: pull tassel. I learned that svg anchor point is on the top left and cannot be centered. Had to adjust by using CSS positioning.
<br>-animated logo on hover
